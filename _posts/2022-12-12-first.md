 [4_scale_CV.pdf](..\materials\4_scale_CV.pdf) 

This is my CV for Ph.D. admission.

I have interdisciplinary background (M.S for power electronics and B.S. for semiconductors and material physics)

I've shown my growth potential in my undergraduate with GPA improvement.

I have five papers (two for TPEL and three for conference), including first author papers (one for TPEL and one for conference) and a corresponding author paper (for conference).

I have wide range of interest in power electronics such as piezoelectric material converter, wireless power transfer, power semiconductor physics and design, battery management system, multi-level converter, resonant converter ...

Finally I will be an accomplished and well-rounded engineer as a professor. In my journey, I believe you will be my great adviser, I will do my best and dedicate myself!

(GPA is calculated with 4.0 scale)

Thank you for your attention!
